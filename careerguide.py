This system uses a simulated dataset of career profiles including skills, education, interests, and experience.

- All features are combined and vectorized.
- A machine learning model (Random Forest) is trained to classify career paths.
- Your input is matched against this model.
- Cosine similarity is added for better matching based on your skills.
- Top 3 most relevant careers are shown based on your profile.
